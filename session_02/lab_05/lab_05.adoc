[abstract]
--
In this lab we will push an ASP.NET MVC web application to cloud foundry.
--

== Create a New ASP.NET Web Application 

. Open Visual Studio and create a new ASP.NET Web Application with the name MVCAttendees
.. Choose MVC as the Template
.. Change the Authentication to No Authentication
. Run it locally to verify that the application works locally

== Publish the Application

. Right click on the project name and select Publish...
. Choose a Custom publish target. 
.. Provide a name like Publish for PCF - Debug
.. Publish method: File System
.. Target location, e.g: ..\PCFDeploy (Remember this location to access it later from the command prompt)
.. Choose a configuration (Debug or Release)
.. (Optional) Change File Publish Options
... Check Delete all existing files prior to publish
... Check Precompile during publishing
. Create a PCF Manifest file
.. Create a manfest.yml file in the Publish Target Location
.. Change the section <your initials> to use your own initials
```

applications:
- name: wsattendees
  host: wsattendees-<your initials>
  memory: 512m
  stack: windows2012R2
  buildpack: binary_buildpack
```

== Push It!

. Open up a command prompt 
. Change to the folder containing the published code files and manifest.yml (Replace "[Publish-Target-Location-folder]" with the actual folder name: 
+
----
> cd [Publish-Target-Location-folder]
----
. Push the application!
+
----
> cf push
