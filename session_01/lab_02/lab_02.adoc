= Lab 2 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
The _Workshop_ application was designed to illustrate the ease with which data services can be bound to and utilized by applications running on Cloud Foundry.
In this lab, we'll be binding the application to a MySQL database.

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

Your instance of the sample _env_ should not be running after the steps completed in lab 1.  Make sure to change to the _ViewEnvironment_ sample application directory.  For this lab we will be using the .NET application.  Deploy the application:

----
> cf push
----

After the application deploys and starts, visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.  Currently, the application sees there aren't any database connections and doesn't show any of the data sections of the page.  Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Cloudfoundry.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
> cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions. On Pivotal Cloudfoundry, the ``free'' tier of plans is normally the first one listed.

The second way is specific to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's Apps Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting https://apps.run.haas-65.pez.pivotal.io

Click on the ''Marketplace'' link:

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

. Let's begin by creating a MySQL service instance.
From the Apps Manager UI service marketplace, select _MySQL_, select the free plan, and provide an instance name.
In the drop-down list next to _Bind to App_ select your workshop application.

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart env`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
> cf restage env
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Env_ application loaded. Click on your app and navigate to _Env Variables_ link. You'll notice now we have information that could be used to connect to the MySQL DB.
In fact, data can now be stored/retrieved into/from that MySQL database!

. You may also verify your service was provisioned in the Apps Manager UI by clicking on your application and selecting the _Services_ tab.

+
You should now see the service created in step 1 listed.

. You may also verify your service was provisioned using the CLI:
+
----
> cf services
----
+
. Now take a look at your app again, you can interact with the database through the new section for attendees. Click on 'Add Attendee' and it should add a row to the database table and refresh it on the screen:

You should now see the service created in step 1 listed and your application listed as a bound app.
