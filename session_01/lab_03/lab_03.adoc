= Lab 3 - Monitoring, Metrics and HA Lab

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloud Foundry makes the work of performing actions, such as managing logs, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the this labs we'll explore some of these capabilities.
--

== Tailing Application Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.
Effective management of logs has historically been difficult or required wiring into third party tools.
Cloud Foundry's https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/loggregator/architecture.html[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it.
Application developers need only log all messages to either 'System.out' in Java or  `STDOUT` or `STDERR` in other languages, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for the application.

----
<1> An ``Apache-style'' access log event from the (Go)Router
<2> An API log event that corresponds to an event as shown in `cf events`
<3> A CELL log event indicating the start of an application instance on that CELL.
====

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interwoven based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system. 

. To get a running ``tail'' of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
> cf logs paragdoshi-articulate
Retrieving logs for app paragdoshi-articulate in org north-area / space development as pdoshi@pivotal.io...
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated.

== Health Management

Cloud Foundry's https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/architecture/#nsync-bbs[components] actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.

. If you don't have one already running, start a log tail for your articulate application. 
+
----
> cf logs paragdoshi-articulate
Connected, tailing logs for app paragdoshi-articulate in org PapaJohns / space workshop as pdoshi@pivotal.io...
----

. If you do not have more than one application instance running, execute the scale command to scale to 2 or more application instances.  Visit the application in the browser, click on 'Scale & HA' link and click on the `Kill' button. This button will trigger an Environment.Exit(-1) causing the Health Manager to observe an application instance crash:
+
image::../../Common/images/kill-button.png[]

. After clicking the kill  a couple of interesting things should happen.
First, you'll see that the application continues to service requests as all requests will now be serviced by the remaining instance (#1 in this example)

Also, if you're paying attention to the log tail, you'll see some interesting log messages fly by:

== Viewing Application _Events_

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `workshop`:

<1> Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we'll start from the bottom.
Here we see the `app.create` event, which created our application's record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. `memory: 1024`).
<2> The `app.map-route` event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.
<3> An `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> An `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
<5> Remember scaling the application up? An `app.update` event records the metadata change `instances: 2`.
<6> Also there's the `app.process.crash` event recording that we encountered a crash of an application instance.

== PCF Metrics

. Along with the logs and events streams, application developers and operators have another tool available to them to monitor the health of their applications - PCF Metrics. And this tool can be accessed by clicking the 'View in PCF Metrics' link for your application in PCF. Log in with your credentials if redirected to log in page.
+
image::../../Common/images/pcf-metrics-link.png[]

. You can view Events, Container and Network metrics and also the logs in one easy to use interface.
